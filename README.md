# youloveevents
You love events is a sample project that show events and uses the public api of ticketmaster. In order to run the app you will need to create a keystore.properties file with the folllowing string:

theTicketmasterKey="1xBl3eTZ5bYDuBU0GMJnmeAf8YTRGNCA"

As a sample project it misses a lot of things that would make it production ready, like pagination for the list of events, better layouts for the ui, styles ecc
The sample intends to show how a MVVM architecture could work with RxJava and LiveData, and following Clean Architecture.
